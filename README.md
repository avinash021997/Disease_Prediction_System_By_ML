Disease Prediction System by ML is a system for the user to identify a disease through which he/she is suffering. To use this system user have to enter the symptoms they have. System will allow user to enter five symptoms and after that user will click on three different buttons which indicates that they prediction 1, prediction2, prediction 3. So, once user clicked on all these three buttons then user get three predictions. Out of these three predictions almost all are same or at least two of these predictions are same. So at the end, user will get to know that from which disease they are suffering.

To make this system, 
I have used three different Machine Learning Algorithms such as 1. Random Forest 2. Naive Bayes 3. Decision Tree
All of these algorithms are classification algorithms of ML and they helped me to classify a symptoms entered by the user.

For GUI of this project I used pythons Tkinter library which helped me to design good quality of interface in less time.
